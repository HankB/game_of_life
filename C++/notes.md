# Notes

place to record durrent efforts and thoughts so that when I set this aside for a couple months, I know what I was trying to do when I come back.

## 2020-12-14

Fix duplicate definitrion of `MyFrame::OnShow()`. What was I trying to accomplish when I put that in?

Problem: scrolling the screen makes multiple artifacts on the display. (Will address later)

Problem: mapping GoL grid coordinates to screen coordinates screwed up. Fixed, but needs cleanup. Lots of debug code included at present.
